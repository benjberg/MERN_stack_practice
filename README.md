# MERN_stack_practice

Build a basic exercise tracking app suing the MERN stack.

I was already familure with the ERN part of the stack so my main focus was learning MongoDB and how non-relational and relational databases differ. 

Learning Mongo was a fun process and fairly easy to pick up as I already had a good base foundation due to learning relational databases. I love how dynamic the data manipulation is with Mongo and really love how easy it is to set up CRUD ops.
